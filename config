# Add this file to ~/.ssh/ of the local machine
# Also place the .pem file downloaded from AWS in the same folder
# This will help to easily connect to remote EC2 instance
# Ex: $ ssh awshost1

Host awshost1
#name of the remote machine that you want to use while sshing in
HostName ec2-**-***-*-**.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com 
#Replace the *** with the public name from AWS EC2 dashboard
User ubuntu
IdentityFile "~/.ssh/xxx.pem"
#Replace xxx with the name of the pem file downloaded from AWS while creating the new EC2 instance
